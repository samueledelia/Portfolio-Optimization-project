This report aims toconstruct portfolios using diverse allocation strategies and evaluate their performance, focusing on the constituents of the S&P100 index. Two performance analyses are carried
out: the first covering the period from May 2021 to May 2022, and the second maintaining the weights derived during the initial period throughout May 2022 and May 2023. Additional analyses
are proposed, including backtesting with rebalancing, and a comparison with a real S&P100 ETF.


This repository encompasses three primary scripts: Run1_group10, Run2_group10, and Run3_ETF_analysis. Each script is tailored to execute distinct tasks within the project:
1. Run1_group10: This script comprises the code relevant to Part A and Part B of Exam C.
2. Run2: Used for backtesting various portfolios with rebalancing. Note that this file will take around 10 min to run.
3. Run3_ETF_analysis: Focuses on the analysis of a portfolio based on iShares S&P 100 ETF (OEF) used to make a real world comparison.
